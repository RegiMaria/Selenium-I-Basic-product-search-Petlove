About Selenium:

Selenium is a widely-used tool for test automation and web navigation automation.
It provides an interface for interacting with web browsers, allowing you to automate tasks such as form filling,
button clicking, page navigation, and many other actions that would typically be performed manually by a user.

Objective:
The main goal of this basic challenge is to:

-Simulate a user accessing the website's search box.
-Retrieve the products.
-Create a list.
-Access products by keywords or index.
-Create a CSV file and write the search results to it.
-Import the CSV file and exclude from the product list those containing specific predefined words.
-Display the filtered products.
-Create a new CSV file named "results_filtered.csv" and write the filtered products to it.

Challenges:
The dynamic nature of the Petlove website is always a significant challenge for me.
The events are highly dynamic, frequently reloading, which quickly renders buttons and actions obsolete.
